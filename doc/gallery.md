New models can be implemented following the tutorial and the MEPLS documentation. However, 
sometimes a model might require a use of MEPLS more advanced than illustrated in the tutorial. In
this case, the @ref Gallery of models shows examples of models built for very specific purposes. 
These
models are located in `/path/to/MEPLS_dir/gallery/`. If you are a user of MEPLS and implement 
a new model, you can submit it to be included in the gallery! 

Currently, the available gallery model,s and their more salient features, are:

  * ESPCI:

    * Random local slip planes as glassy microstructure
    
    * Monte Carlo simulation of a super-cooled liquid
    
    * Athermal quasistatic strain-controlled test
    
    * Unloading and reloading
    
    * Sampling local elasto-plastic response using the patch method
