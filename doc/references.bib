The present STZ dynamics model is adapted to incorporate a structure-related state variable, and evolves via two competing processes: STZ activation, which creates free volume, vs. diffusive rearrangement, which annihilates it. The dynamical competition between these two processes gives rise to an equilibrium excess free volume that can be connected to flow viscosity via the phenomenological Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann relation in relaxed structures near the glass transition temperature. On the other hand, the excess free volume allows glasses to deform at low temperatures via shear localization into shear bands, even in the presence of internal stress distributions that arise upon cooling after processing."

abstract = {This study reviews several problems which are specific of composites with periodic microstructure composed of linear or nonlinear constituents. The theoretical background of the method is recalled first. Two different families of numerical methods are considered to solve the problem. The first is based on the Finite Element Method. The concept of ‘macroscopic degrees of freedom’ is presented. The implementation of periodicity conditions is discussed. A general framework permitting either a strain or stress control is proposed. The second numerical method is based on Fast Fourier Transforms. It considers first the problem of a homogeneous linear reference material undergoing a nonhomogeneous periodic eigenstrain. The solution of this problem is based on the explicit form of the periodic Green's function of the reference medium. The relative merits of the two methods are compared and several examples are discussed. Both methods give very comparable results on test examples and their domains of applications appear to be complementary.}

	abstract = {The ubiquitous appearance of regions of localized deformation (shear bands) in diﬀerent kinds of disordered materials under shear is studied in the context of a mesoscopic model of plasticity. The model allows us to include relaxational (ageing) eﬀects. In the absence of relaxational eﬀects the model displays a monotonically increasing dependence of stress on strain rate, and stationary shear bands do not occur. However in start-up experiments transient (although long lived) shear bands occur, that widen without bound in time. I investigate this transient eﬀect in detail, reproducing and explaining a t1/2 law for the thickness increase of the shear band that has been obtained in atomistic numerical simulations. Relaxation produces a negatively sloped region in the stress versus strain-rate curve that stabilizes the formation of shear bands of a well-deﬁned width, which is a function of strain rate. Simulations at very low strain rates reveal a non-trivial stick–slip dynamics of very thin shear bands that has relevance in the study of seismic phenomena. In addition, other nonstationary processes, such as stop-and-go, or strain-rate inversion situations display a phenomenology that matches very well the results of recent experimental studies.},

It associates geometrically unfavored motifs, i.e., those most disordered local polyhedral packing structures in a metallic glass, with the soft spots defined from the vibrational modes and correlates them with shear transformation zones composed of atoms with large nonaffine displacements. The statistical correlation established thus ties together the heterogeneity inherent in the amorphous structure with the spatial heterogeneity in the mechanical (elastic and plastic) properties of a metallic glass.In a 3D model mimicking realistic Cu64Zr36 metallic glass, we uncovered a direct link between the quasi-localized low-frequency vibrational modes and the local atomic packing structure. We also demonstrate that quasi-localized soft modes correlate strongly with fertile sites for shear transformations: geometrically unfavored motifs constitute the most flexible local environments that encourage soft modes and high propensity for shear transformations, whereas local configurations preferred in this alloy, i.e., the full icosahedra (around Cu) and Z16 Kasper polyhedra (around Zr), contribute the least.},

	abstract = {Glassy materials are characterized by a lack of long-range order, whether at the atomic level or at much larger length scales. But to what extent is their commonality in the behavior retained at these different scales? Cubuk et al. used experiments and simulations to show universality across seven orders of magnitude in length. Particle rearrangements in such systems are mediated by defects that are on the order of a few particle diameters. These rearrangements correlate with the material{\textquoteright}s softness and yielding behavior.Science, this issue p. 1033When deformed beyond their elastic limits, crystalline solids flow plastically via particle rearrangements localized around structural defects. Disordered solids also flow, but without obvious structural defects. We link structure to plasticity in disordered solids via a microscopic structural quantity, {\textquotedblleft}softness,{\textquotedblright} designed by machine learning to be maximally predictive of rearrangements. Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.},

Concepts and physical models of plastic deformation in amorphous materials on the other hand—where the concept of linear lattice defects is not applicable—still are lagging behind. We introduce an eigenstrain-based finite element lattice model for simulations of shear band formation and strain avalanches. Our model allows us to study the influence of surfaces and finite size effects on the statistics of avalanches. We find that even with relatively complex loading conditions and open boundary conditions, critical exponents describing avalanche statistics are unchanged, which validates the use of simpler scalar lattice-based models to study these phenomena.}

During creep deformation, the structural properties of a material evolve as a function of time. By means of a generic coarse-grained mesoscopic elastoplastic model which envisages deformation as a sequence of stochastically activated discrete events, we study the creep deformation of disordered materials. We find that the structural evolution of the material during creep modifies not only the average material properties but also changes the statistics of those properties. We analyze the emergence of correlations in the strain localization and deformation activity patterns, the variation of the event rate and the evolution of the inter-event time distribution. We find that the event rate follows the Omori law of aftershocks, which is the discrete counterpart of Andrade's transient creep law, and that the exponent of these laws only depends on the microstructural heterogeneity. Finally, we find during the initial stages of transient creep a transition from Poisson distributed inter-event times towards a non-trivial power law distribution.},

The modeling framework considers the shear transformation zone (STZ) as the fundamental unit of deformation, and coarse-grains an amorphous collection of atoms into an ensemble of \{STZs\} on a mesh. By employing finite element analysis and a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, the modeling technique is capable of simulating glass processing and deformation on time and length scales greater than those usually attainable by atomistic modeling. A thorough explanation of the framework is presented, along with a specific two-dimensional implementation for a model metallic glass. The model is shown to capture the basic behaviors of metallic glasses, including high-temperature homogeneous flow following the expected constitutive law, and low-temperature strain localization into shear bands. Details of the effects of processing and thermal history on the glass structure and properties are also discussed. },

Atomistic as well as continuum modeling and experimental work on elasticity, plastic flow and localization, fracture and fatigue are all discussed, and theoretical developments are connected, where possible, with macroscopic experimental responses. The role of glass structure on mechanical properties, and conversely, the effect of deformation upon glass structure, are also described. The mechanical properties of metallic glass-derivative materials – including in situ and ex situ composites, foams and nanocrystal-reinforced glasses – are reviewed as well. Finally, we identify a number of important unresolved issues for the field. },

The equivalent homogeneous inclusion problem has an explicit solution in terms of a definite integral. The approach allows solving the problems about inclusions of arbitrary shape, multiple inclusion problems, and lends itself to residual stress analysis in non-uniform, heterogeneous media. The fundamental formulation introduced here will find application in the mechanics of composites, inclusions, phase transformation analysis, plasticity, fracture mechanics, etc."

The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

Non-negative dissipation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for satisfying the Clausius–Duhem inequality which requires the dissipation rate to be non-negative. Here, a general expression is given for the dissipation rate with multiple transforming Eshelby inclusions. When specialized to a single transforming Eshelby inclusion in an infinite solid, the limit on the magnitude of transformation strain for non-negative dissipation rate is one half that for non-negative dissipation. The condition for non-negative dissipation rate is expressed as the product of a configurational force, analogous to the Peach–Koehler force for dislocations and to the J-integral for cracks, times the transformation strain rate. This gives a natural framework for specifying kinetic relations that guarantee a non-negative dissipation rate for Eshelby inclusions. Simple kinetic relations are proposed for the mesoscale modeling of the shear transformation zone (STZ) mechanism of plastic deformation in amorphous solids. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate implementation in a computational framework of a kinetic relation that guarantees a non-negative dissipation rate. Possible limitations of a linear elastic Eshelby inclusion model for the STZ plasticity mechanism are discussed in light of results from atomistic analyses.},

The theory is based on two modes of thermally activated shear transformations initiated around free volume regions under an applied shear stress. The regions are typically conceived to be about 5 atom diameters across. At high temperatures (0.6 Tg ≲ T ≲ Tg) the transformation is a diffuse rearrangement producing a relatively small local shear strain in a roughly spherical region. At low temperatures (0 < T ≲ 0.6 Tg) the transformation is in a narrow disk shaped region and resembles closely the nucleation of a dislocation loop. The theory is in good accord with experimental observations. Based on the theory, possible levels of flow dilatation have been computed from which rates of shear localization can be obtained. At low temperatures, very rapid shear localization is predicted which is in good accord with the observations reported in the literature and with recent cinematographic observations.
	Résumé
	On présente une théorie de la déformation plastique des verres métalliques en-dessous de leur température de transition vitreuse. Cette théorie repose sur deux modes de transformation par cisaillement thermiquement activés, qui débutent autour de régions de volume libre, sous l'action d'une contrainte appliquée. On considère que ces régions doivent avoir un diamètre d'environ cinq atomes. Aux températures élevées (0.6 Tg ≲ T ≲ Tg), la transformation consiste en un réarrangement diffus produisant une cission locale relativement faible dans une région grossièrement sphérique. Aux basses températures (0 < T ≲ 0.6 Tg), la transformation se produit dans une région étroite qui a la forme d'un disque, et elle ressemble étroitement à la germination d'une boucle de dislocation. La théorie est en bon accord avec les observations expérimentales. On a calculé, en utilisant cette théorie, les niveaux possibles de la dilatation d'écoulement, à partir desquels on peut obtenir les vitesses de localisation du cisaillement. Aux basses températures, on prévoit une très rapide localisation du cisaillement, ce qui est en bon accord avec les observations publiées dans la littérature et avec des observations cinématographiques récentes.
	Zusammenfassung
	Es wird eine Theorie zur Beschreibung der plastischen Verformung metallischer Gläser unterhalb der Glasübergangstemperatur Tg vorgelegt. Diese Theorie baut auf zwei Moden thermisch aktivierter Schertransformationen auf, die unter einer angelegten Scherspannung im Bereich freier Volumina entstehen. Diese Bereiche mögen etwa 5 Atomdurchmesser groβ sein. Bei hohen Temperaturen (0.6 Tg ≲ T ≲ Tg) besteht die Transformation in einer diffusen Umlagerung, welche zu einer relativ kleinen lokalen Scherverzerrung in einem näherungsweise sphärischen Bereich führt. Bei niedrigen Temperaturen (0 < T ≲ 0.6 Tg) läuft die Transformation in einem schmalen scheibenförmigen Bereich ab und gleicht nahezu der Erzeugung eines Versetzungsringes. Die Theorie stimmt gut mit experimentellen Beobachtungen überein. Mit Hilf der Theorie wurden mögliche Niveaus der Dehnung berechnet, aus denen die Geschwindigkeiten der Scherlokalisierung erhalten werden können. Für niedrige Temperaturen wird eine sehr rasche Scherlokalisierung vorausgesagt, welches mit den in der Literatur berichteten Beobachtungen und mit neueren kinematografischen Beobachtungen gut übereinstimmt.},

After a linear stress-strain behavior, the system undergoes a noisy plastic flow. We show that the plastic flow is spatially heterogeneous. Two kinds of plastic events occur in the system: quadrupolar localized rearrangements, and shear bands. The analysis of the individual motion of a particle shows also two regimes: a hyper-diffusive regime followed by a diffusive regime, even at zero temperature.},

These different mechanisms give metallic glasses high strength, but the extent to which they affect other macroscopic deformation properties is uncertain. For example, the nature of the plastic-yield criterion is a point of contention, with some studies reporting yield behaviour roughly in line with that of polycrystalline metals, and others indicating strong fundamental differences. In particular, it is unclear whether pressure- or normal stress-dependence needs to be included in the plastic-yield criterion of metallic glasses, and how such a dependence could arise from their disordered structure1,2,3,4. In this work we provide an atomic-level explanation for pressure-dependent yield in amorphous metals, based on an elementary unit of deformation. This simple model compares favourably with new atomistic simulations of metallic glasses, as well as existing experimental data.},

	abstract = {Shear transformations (i.e., localized rearrangements of particles resulting in the shear deformation of a small region of the sample) are the building blocks of mesoscale models for the flow of disordered solids. In order to compute the time-dependent response of the solid material to such a shear transformation, with a proper account of elastic heterogeneity and shear wave propagation, we propose and implement a very simple Finite-Element (FE)-based method. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a binary Lennard–Jones glass are used as a benchmark for comparison, and information about the microscopic viscosity and the local elastic constants is directly extracted from the MD system and used as input in FE. We find very good agreement between FE and MD regarding the temporal evolution of the disorder-averaged displacement field induced by a shear transformation, which turns out to coincide with the response of a uniform elastic medium. However, fluctuations are relatively large, and their magnitude is satisfactorily captured by the FE simulations of an elastically heterogeneous system. Besides, accounting for elastic anisotropy on the mesoscale is not crucial in this respect. The proposed method thus paves the way for models of the rheology of amorphous solids which are both computationally efficient and realistic, in that structural disorder and inertial effects are accounted for.},

Recent approaches propose inferring predictors from a variety of human-defined features using machine learning. Here we determine the long-time evolution of a glassy system solely from the initial particle positions and without any handcrafted features, using graph neural networks as a powerful model. We show that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, generalizing over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities. In shear experiments, it predicts the locations of rearranging particles. The structural predictors learned by our network exhibit a correlation length that increases with larger timescales to reach the size of our system. Beyond glasses, our method could apply to many other physical systems that map to a graph of local interaction.},

Modeling and simulation is the essential bridge from good science to good engineering, spanning from fundamental understanding of materials behavior to deliberate design of new materials technologies leveraging new properties and processes. This Roadmap presents a broad overview of the extensive impact computational modeling has had in materials science in the past few decades, and offers focused perspectives on where the path forward lies as this rapidly expanding field evolves to meet the challenges of the next few decades. The Roadmap offers perspectives on advances within disciplines as diverse as phase field methods to model mesoscale behavior and molecular dynamics methods to deduce the fundamental atomic-scale dynamical processes governing materials response, to the challenges involved in the interdisciplinary research that tackles complex materials problems where the governing phenomena span different scales of materials behavior requiring multiscale approaches. The shift from understanding fundamental materials behavior to development of quantitative approaches to explain and predict experimental observations requires advances in the methods and practice in simulations for reproducibility and reliability, and interacting with a computational ecosystem that integrates new theory development, innovative applications, and an increasingly integrated software and computational infrastructure that takes advantage of the increasingly powerful computational methods and computing hardware.}
