/*! This namespace contains tools for creating and testing patches. Patches are
 * connected sub-domains of the full system, which are cut-out and mechanically
 * shear-tested in isolation (see @cite DFCastellanos_CRP @cite Patinet2016 @cite Barbot2018).
 *  In elasto-plastic models, patches are composed by mesoscale elements and
 *  represented as a @ref system::System object, with the same properties and evolution laws as
 *  the full-size system from where they are cut-out. Performing shear tests on individual patches
 * provides statistical information about the spatially-fluctuating local
 * mechanical response of the system. While full systems can be periodic or
 * non-periodic patches are, by definition, non-periodic. Therefore, computing
 * elastic fields within patches require solving elastic problems in the
 * presence of surfaces.
 *
 * Three different states during a shear test are distinguished:
 * 1. Stable sate ("ss"). The patch state previous to the initiation of the 
 * test.
 * 2. The onset of instability ("oi"). The state of the patch at the very
 * moment of the first mechanical instability (i.e., at the moment of
 * activation of the first slip event within the patch).
 * 3. End-of-event state ("ee"). The state of the patch when the plastic
 * deformation initiated in the oi-state has finished. Note that such
 * plastic deformation can, in general, be composed of several slip
 * systems beyond the initial one triggered in the oi-state. */
