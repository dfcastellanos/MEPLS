 * (see \cite DFCastellanos_CRP). This abstract class provides a common interface for derived
 * slip classes, which implement specific activation rules.
 * Essentially, slip systems are defined by a slip plane, an effective shear
 * stress on that plane, and the critical effective shear stress known as the
 * threshold that defines when the system becomes mechanically activated. The
 * interplay between these quantities is implemented by derived classes. This class
 * serves as a common interface for the slip classes.
